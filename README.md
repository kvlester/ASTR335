# Python activities for ASTR 335 
In-class python notebooks created for my Fall 2023 Astrophysics II (Stellar Structure & Evolution) class at Mount Holyoke College. Students ran these notebooks in Google Colab. Each folder has the jupyter notebook and necessary data set(s) for each activity. 

Activity 1 - Python basics (arrays, math, plotting, reading in data)

Activity 2 - (a) Calculating the enclosed mass of a star using stellar structure equations. (b) Calculating stellar density for different spectral types

Activity 3 - (a) Modifying Activity 2 to also calculate the pressure profile. (b) Random walk example

Activity 4 - Isochrone fitting for the Pleiades cluster

Activity 5 - Spectral types & spectrum template matching

Activity 6 - Spectroscopic binary star orbit

My students also completed a final project to redo one of these activities on a new "unknown" data set, write up a mini journal article, and present their results to the class.

You're welcome to email me if you would like the solutions to the activities, or if you have any suggestions / comments on the activities!
